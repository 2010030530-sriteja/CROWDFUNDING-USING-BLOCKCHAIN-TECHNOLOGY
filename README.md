# CROWDFUNDING-USING-BLOCKCHAIN-TECHNOLOGY


The issue of transparency and security is very paramount in any organization, especially in organizations providing crowdfunding platforms, therefore the intention to provide a reliable, secured, transparent and decentralized solution is achieved by developing a blockchain-based crowdfunding web application. This crowdfunding application is not just like any other application which just allows people to invest their money, but this platform also gives an assurance to the backers that returns will be guaranteed.
